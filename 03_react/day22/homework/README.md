# Lab & Homework

The objective of this homework assignment is to enhance the visual appearance of the React application we have built as part of our code-along session. By adding CSS styles, you will have the opportunity to personalize the application's design and layout, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Instructions:

- Review the React application code we developed during the code-along session. Familiarize yourself with the components and their structure.

- Identify the areas of the application where you would like to apply CSS styles. This could include the overall layout, headers, navigation menus, buttons, forms, or any other elements you deem necessary.

- Create a new CSS file or modify the existing CSS file associated with the application (if one exists). You may name the file `styles.css` or any other suitable name.

- Open the CSS file and write CSS rules to style the desired elements. Make sure to use appropriate CSS selectors and property-value pairs to achieve the desired effects.

- Apply the CSS styles to the React components in the application. You can do this by importing the CSS file into your React component files using the import statement.

- Test the application to ensure that the CSS styles are being applied correctly. Verify that the visual changes match your intended design.

- Experiment with different CSS properties, such as color, font-family, padding, margin, background-color, border, etc., to further customize the appearance of the application.
