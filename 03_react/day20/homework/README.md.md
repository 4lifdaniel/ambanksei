## Requirements
Using React and React Router, build a simple website showcasing the details for
all the Star Wars Movies. Your app will have a sidebar, listing all the Star Wars
movies and linking to a show page in the main section of the page. When a user
clicks on a movie from the sidebar list, they should see the details for that
movie rendered in the main content area of the page. Use the data provided in
`data.json`.
