## Background Color Changer

Create an HTML page with three buttons, each representing a different color. When a button is clicked, the background color of the page should change to the color associated with that button. Please follow the instructions below to complete the task:

1. Create an HTML file with a basic structure, including the <!DOCTYPE> declaration, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

2. Inside the <body> tags, add a <div> element with an id attribute. This div will serve as the container for the buttons and will represent the page's background area. Give it some content, such as a heading or a paragraph, so you can easily see the background color change.

3. Create three <button> elements within the <div> element. Give each button a unique id attribute and some text to indicate the color it represents (e.g., Red, Green, Yellow).

4. Add JavaScript code to handle the button clicks and change the background color accordingly. You can achieve this by using the `document.getElementById()` method to retrieve each button element by its id, and then adding an event listener to listen for click events. When a button is clicked, change the background color of the <div> element using the `style.backgroundColor` property.

5. Test your webpage by opening it in a web browser and clicking on each button. Verify that the background color changes according to the button pressed.

6. Once you have completed the task, save your HTML file and submit it for evaluation.
