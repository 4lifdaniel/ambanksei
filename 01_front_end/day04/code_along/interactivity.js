//Pseduo Code:
//Psuedo code is process of taking larger solution 
//and breaking it to programmable steps with out actually writing any code.
/*
- Assertions:
    Probably statement, assumptions
- Conditionals:
    if, unless, otherwise
- Loops
    something we want to do multiple times

- Functions
    when we want to create a simplified step(which will be used multiple times)
