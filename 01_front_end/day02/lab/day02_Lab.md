# Intro to Loops and Conditionals

An introductory lab to loops and conditionals in JavaScript/

#### Learning Objectives

- Practice using conditionals and / or loops to solve problems

#### Prerequisites

- Introductory lesson to JavaScript

---

## Getting Started

1. Create a file called `lab_solutions.js` .



## Directions
Write loops, `if`, or `if, else` statements to complete the following questions. Some of the problems may require you to use a loop inside the conditional. Refer back to your class notes from today if you need help.

## Conceptual Questions

Rate your understanding of the following questions on a scale of 1 - 5. If your understanding is less than or equal to 3, research the answer or ask for help:

1. How do we assign a value to a variable?
  - Which line(s) is/are valid?

    ```js
    let a = 0;
    const b = 1;
    9 = a;
    b = b + 5;
    ```

2. How do we change the value of a variable?
3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?

## Let's get Mathy!

```js
const a = 42.78
const b = 1.1
const c = -2
const d = .5
const e = 16
```

- Round `a` down
- Round `b` up
- Find the absolute value of `b - a`
- Find the largest number of `a, b, c, d, e`
- Find the smallest number of `a, b, c, d, e`
- Find the square root of `e`
- Raise `e` to the power of `d`
- Make a digital die 0 generate a random number between 1 - 6 

## Strings Activity 1

### Strings - Switcharoo
1. Create a variable called `firstVariable`.
1. assign it the value of a string: `"Hello World"`
1. On the next line, change the value of this variable to a number.
1. store the value of `firstVariable` into a new variable called `secondVariable`
1. On the next line, change the value of `secondVariable` to a string.
1. What is the value of `firstVariable`?

### Strings - Combine it
1. Create a variable called `yourName` and set it equal to your name as a string.
  - Write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable `yourName` so that it prints a new string with them concatenated

>ex: `Hello, my name is Bharath Kumar`

## Booleans Activity
- Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks with a mathematical or boolean operator **that evaluates the expression to true**.

[MDN Comparison Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)

```
  const a = 6;
  const b = 100;
  const c = -5;
  const d = 3000;
  const e = 'Jelly Bean';
```

1.  a _ b;
1.  c _ d;
1.  'Peanut' _ 'Peanut';
1.  a _ b _ c;
1.  e _ 'Jelly Bean';
1.  48 _ '48';
1. 'e' _ 'Eh'

...


## The Farm
1) Write code that will print out "mooooo" if the variable `animal` is equal to `cow`.

2) Change your code so that if the variable `animal` is anything other than a cow, your should print out "Hey! You're not a cow."

## Driver's Ed

1) Write a variable that will hold a person's age.

2) Write code that will print out "Here are the keys", if the age is 16 years or older.

3) Change your code so that if the age is younger than 16, a message will print "Sorry, you're too young."

## Just Loop It
1) Write code that will print out all the numbers in the range 0 - 10.

2) Write code that will print out all the numbers in the range  500 - 50.


## Let's get odd
1) Print out the odd numbers that are within the range of 1 - 100.

2) Adjust your code to add a message next to the odd number that says: "is an odd number".

>Example Output:
```
3 is an odd number
5 is an odd number
7 is an odd number
```

## Give me Five
1) For the numbers 0 - 100, print out "I found a `number`. High five!" if the number is a multiple of five.

>Example Output:
```
I found a 5. High five!
I found a 10. High five!
```

2) Add to the code from above to print out "I found a `number`. Three is a crowd" if the number is a multiple of three.

>Example Output:
```
I found a 3. Three is a crowd
I found a 5. High five!
I found a 6. Three is a crowd
I found a 9. Three is a crowd
I found a 10. High five!
```

## Fibonacci
Fibonacci is a classic example in coding. Its name will appear often. In its essence, it is adding numbers together in a specific sequence. Don't let the inherent 'mathyness' or fancy name scare you. You've got this!

Here are some sequences, can you figure out the next number? Can you figure out the pattern so you could write a loop to generate these?:

1, 2, 3, 4

Here is another one:

2, 4, 6, 8

And another:

5, 10, 15, 20

and one more:

2, 4, 8, 16, 32

Fibonacci is just another sequence of numbers.

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:


```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...


1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
3 + 5 = 8
8 + 5 = 13
```

Can you see the pattern?

Think about how you would create that pattern using JavaScript
<br>

Here is the challenge: By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Fun fact! Fibonacci appears often in nature. [Check it out](https://prezi.com/ji8szidelmbw/httpjwilsoncoeugaeduemat6680parveenfib_naturehtm/)  

Feeling overwhelmed?

- Start with some pseudoecode!
- First just try to console.log the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
- Try thinking of the smallest step, solve it and then find the next step to take

# Arrays and conditionals Lab:

Using combinations of arrays, loops, and conditionals to solve problems

#### Learning Objectives

- Practice using combinations of arrays, loops, and conditionals to solve problems

## Exercises

### Easy Does It
1. Create an array that contains three quotes and store it in a variable called `quotes`.

### Random
Given the following array `const randomThings = [1, 10, "Hello", true]`

1. how do you access the 1st element in the array?

2. Reassign the value of `"Hello"` to `"World"`.

3. Check the value of the array to make sure it updated the array.

### We've Got Class
Given the following array `const ourClass = ["Stan Lee", "Zoom", "Github", "Slack"]`

1. What would you write to access the 3rd element of the array?

2. Change the value of "Github" to "Octocat"

3. Add a new element, "Cloud City" to the array.

### Mix It Up
1. Given the following array `const myArray = [5 ,10 ,500, 20]`

1. Using the `push` method, add the string `"Egon"` to the end of the array.

1. Using a method, remove the string from the end of the array.

1. Using the `unshift` method, add the string `"Bob Marley"` to the beginning of the array

1. Using a different method, remove the string from the beginning of the array

1. Use the reverse method on this array

### Biggie Smalls
Write an `if..else` statement that iterates over the `myArray` array declared above:

1. console.log `little number` if the number is entered is less than **100**

2. If the number entered is 100 or more, alert `big number`.

### Monkey in the Middle
Write an `if...else if...else` statement:

1. console.log `little number` if the number entered is less than **5**.<br>

2.  If the number entered is more than 10, log `big number`.

3. Otherwise, console.log "monkey". <br>

### What's in Your Closet?

Below, we've given you examples of Kristyn and Thom's closets modeled as data in JavaScript.

```javascript
const kristynsCloset = [
  "left shoe",
  "cowboy boots",
  "right sock",
  "GA hoodie",
  "green pants",
  "yellow knit hat",
  "marshmallow peeps"
];

// Thom's closet is more complicated. Check out this nested data structure!!
const thomsCloset = [
  [
    // These are Thom's shirts
    "grey button-up",
    "dark grey button-up",
    "light blue button-up",
    "blue button-up",
  ],[
    // These are Thom's pants
    "grey jeans",
    "jeans",
    "PJs"
  ],[
    // Thom's accessories
    "wool mittens",
    "wool scarf",
    "raybans"
  ]
];
```

1. What's Kristyn wearing today? Using bracket notation to access items in `kristynsCloset`, log the sentence "Kristyn is rocking that " + *the third item in Kristyn's closet* + " today!" to the console.

1. Kristyn can't find her left shoe. Remove this item from her closet and save it to a variable named `kristynShoe`.

1. Kristyn just bought some sweet shades! Add `"raybans"` to her closet **after `"yellow knit hat"`.**

1. Kristyn spilled coffee on her hat... modify this item to read `"stained knit hat"` instead of yellow.

1. Put together an outfit for Thom! Using **bracket notation**, access the first element in Thom's `shirts` array.

1. In the same way, access one item from Thom's pants array.

1. Access one item from Thom's accessories array.

1. Log a sentence about what Thom's wearing. Example: `"Thom is looking fierce in a grey button-up, jeans and wool scarf!"`

1. Get more specific about what kind of PJs Thom's wearing this winter. Modify the name of his PJ pants to `Footie Pajamas`.

### Additional Practice:

Write a loop that prints the numbers in order:

```js
const twoDArray = [
  [9,8,7],
  [6,5,4],
  [3,2,1],
];
```
expect:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```
Try using `for of` loops instead of a regular `for` loop - does it make sense for this task?
