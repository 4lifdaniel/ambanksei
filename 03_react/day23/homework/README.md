# PERN Homework

As part of today's lab, you have created a simple PERN stack application, here are some homework exercises to help you solidify your understanding:

1. Modify the GET `/api/todos` endpoint to return only completed todos.
1. Modify the POST `/api/todos` endpoint to return the newly created todo in the response.
1. Add error handling to the server, so that if an error occurs, a useful error message is returned to the client.
1. Create a new React frontend for the application, using fetch to interact with the API endpoints.
