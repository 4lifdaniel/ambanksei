# Capstone Assignment Guidelines: Banking Analytics Dashboard

## Introduction

The purpose of this capstone assignment is to develop a banking analytics dashboard that demonstrates the application of data analytics, web development, and visualization skills in the banking domain.

In this project, you will use a combination of Excel, HTML, JS, AJAX, Node.js, Express.js, and React to build an interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights into banking data.

## Assignment Overview

The banking analytics dashboard project aims to provide a comprehensive view of banking data and enable users to analyze key metrics and trends. By building this dashboard, you will gain practical experience in data extraction, cleaning, backend development, frontend implementation, and visualization techniques. The project will also highlight the significance of data analytics and visualization in the banking industry.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

To complete the capstone project, you should focus on delivering the following minimum viable product (MVP) features:

- **Data extraction and cleaning**: Utilize Excel to extract and clean the dataset.

- **Backend development**: Build a backend using Node.js and Express.js to handle data storage and retrieval.

- **Database management**: Utilize a NoSQL database like MongoDB to store and manage the cleaned banking data.

- **Integration with frontend**: Create APIs using Express.js to connect the backend with the frontend.

- **Basic visualizations**: Use React to display basic charts and metrics based on the banking data.

## Bonus Points

In addition to the MVP, you can earn bonus points by implementing the following additional features or enhancements:

- **Advanced data cleaning techniques**: Apply advanced data cleaning techniques in Excel to handle complex data inconsistencies.

- **User authentication and authorization**: Implement user authentication and authorization using Sessions to secure the dashboard.

- **Interactive and dynamic visualizations**: Enhance the frontend by creating interactive and dynamic visualizations using libraries like `D3.js` or `Chart.js`.

- **Real-time data updates**: Implement real-time data updates using WebSocket technology to provide live updates of banking metrics.

- **Responsive design principles**: Incorporate responsive design principles to ensure optimal display of the dashboard on different devices.

## Deliverables

Upon completion of the capstone project, you are expected to deliver the following:

- **Detailed project report**: Prepare a project report documenting the entire process, including the challenges faced, methodologies employed, and key insights gained during the development of the banking analytics dashboard.

- **Source code repository**: Create a source code repository containing the backend and frontend code, properly documented, and organized.

- **Deployed dashboard**: Deploy the banking analytics dashboard on a cloud platform such as render or Netlify to make it accessible online.

## Evaluation Criteria

The capstone projects will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Completeness of MVP features and functionality.
- Quality and correctness of the code implementation.
- Design and usability of the user interface.
- Use of best practices in data analytics, web development, and visualization.
- Creativity and innovation in addressing banking-related challenges.

## Timeline

To guide you through the project, here is a suggested timeline for completing the capstone assignment:

- **Day 1**: Data extraction and cleaning using Excel.

- **Day 2**: Backend development with `Node.js` and `Express.js`, and database management with MongoDB/ Postgres.

- **Day 3**: Integration of frontend with backend APIs using AJAX, and implementation of basic visualizations using React.

- **Day 4**: Refinement, documentation, and deployment of the banking analytics dashboard.

## Conclusion

By completing this capstone project, you will not only showcase your proficiency in data analytics and web development but also gain valuable experience in building a practical banking analytics dashboard. Remember to seek help, collaborate with peers, and explore additional functionalities beyond the MVP to make your project stand out.

Here are a few examples of real-world dashboards that you can draw inspiration from for your banking analytics dashboard:

**Sales Performance Dashboard**: This type of dashboard provides insights into the bank's sales performance, including revenue, customer acquisition, and product performance. It may include visualizations such as line charts for tracking sales over time, bar charts for comparing revenue by product or region, and funnel charts for analyzing the sales pipeline.

**Customer Analytics Dashboard**: This dashboard focuses on customer-related metrics, such as customer segmentation, retention rates, and customer lifetime value. It may include visualizations such as pie charts for customer segmentation, line charts for tracking customer churn, and heatmaps for analyzing customer behavior.

**Risk Management Dashboard**: A risk management dashboard helps monitor and mitigate various risks faced by the bank, such as credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. It may include visualizations such as radar charts for risk assessment, stacked bar charts for tracking risk exposure, and heatmaps for identifying high-risk areas.

**Financial Performance Dashboard**: This type of dashboard provides an overview of the bank's financial performance, including key financial metrics such as revenue, expenses, profitability, and return on investment. It may include visualizations such as line charts for tracking financial metrics over time, doughnut charts for expense breakdown, and waterfall charts for analyzing profit margins.

**Loan Portfolio Dashboard**: A loan portfolio dashboard allows monitoring and analyzing the bank's loan portfolio, including loan types, default rates, and portfolio composition. It may include visualizations such as stacked bar charts for loan distribution, line charts for tracking default rates, and bubble charts for analyzing loan amounts and risk.

**Market Insights Dashboard**: This dashboard focuses on providing insights into market trends, stock prices, and financial news related to the banking industry.
